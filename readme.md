- Parcel

Link: https://parceljs.org/

The zero configuration build tool for React, Node, Sass, images, TypeScript... Parcel's JavaScript compiler and source maps implementation are **written in Rust for maximum performance**. It's 10-20x faster than other JavaScript-based tools! Parcel implements dependency collection, bundling, scope hoisting, tree shaking, Node emulation, hot reloading, and more.

Parcel is designed around a multi-core architecture that **parallelizes work across all of your cores** and takes full advantage of modern hardware.

Everything Parcel does is **cached** â€“ transformation, dependency resolution, bundling, optimizing, and everything in between. This means the dev server restarts instantly, and the same code is never built twice.

In development, Parcel can defer building files until they are requested in the browser. This means you only need to wait for the page you're actually working on to build!

Parcel optimizes your whole app for production automatically. This includes tree-shaking and minifying your JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, resizing and optimizing images, content hashing, automatic code splitting, and much more.

Parcel automatically includes content hashes in the names of all output files. This enables **long-term browser caching**, because the output is guaranteed not to change unless the name does.
